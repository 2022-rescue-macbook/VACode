# VACode: A Visual Analytics Systems for Learner-Sourced Code in Large-Scale Computer Science Education

VACode is a visual analytics system that allows instructors to analyze learner-sourced code and to assign groups for code-review-based peer-assisted learning. Learner-sourced programming codes are embedded to high-dimensional vector with [codeBERT](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT) and visualized with [t-SNE](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf?fbcl). Then, student groups are assigned based on Unshift Clustering Algorithms. Instructors can see source-codes' overview in Plot View, filter with Label View and Group View, and check raw source-code with Code View.
